				<div id="zorblax"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="info">
				<p>The planet Zorblax is the only inhabited planet in the Antares Star System.
					Zorblaxians are peaceful and have a very scientific culture. They can be rude
					to strangers and travellers who do not bother to learn their language. Most major
					cities are in Zorblax's southern hemisphere, while the north is the primary source of agriculture.
				</p>
				<p>We recommend travelling between November and March, when the crowds are lowest.
					Late winter offers the best deals on starflights and lodging.You muust visit the
					Museum of Squid-Monster Fossils. Situated in downtown Canto, this is the one place to go if your
					time on Zorblax is limited.

				<p>After two centuries of civil war, Thongor is finally open to tourism again!
					The rebel's have overthrown the armies of the evil Thongorian Empire, and this
					oblong planet is finally safe to visit again. Don't forget to bring a jacket:
					Thongor is covered with snow year-round. It may be cold, but it's worth the shivers for a chance to
					see a performance by the famous Thongorian Opera.
				</p>
				<p>The snow is too thick to travel by car, and the airline industry on Thongor hasn't recovered from the
					war yet. You'll have to lean to ride a Dewluck! You must visit the Thongorian Opera House. They have
					the best singers in the entire galaxy!
